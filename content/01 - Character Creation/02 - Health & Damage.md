Health in this system is pretty simple. 

Instead of traditional HP, where it's a flat number, instead you have injury _levels_. There are three by default, but you can add more.

| Injury Level | Ramifications                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| None         | You're fit as a fiddle!                                                 |
| Superficial  | You've got some scratches on you, but you're mostly fine.               |
| Severe       | You've taken some more serious damage: broken bones, deep bruises, etc. |
| Death        | You've unfortunately passed on.                                         |

Moving between each of the injury levels is largely based on how you want to play, but generally, you move sequentially from one injury level to another.

If you have an item or trait that has a healing factor, you can use it according to its rules.
