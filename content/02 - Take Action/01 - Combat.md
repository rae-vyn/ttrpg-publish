Combat in this system, unlike others, doesn't have an order by default. Instead, the combat happens asynchronously with the rest of the world. Characters in combat are locked into combat for the most part, but those outside of it are free to join in as they please.

Combat usually starts when someone gets attacked, and ends whenever a character passes out, dies, flees, or surrenders.

Evasive maneuvers or blocking are contested rolls of whatever skill is applicable. For example, a simple unarmed strike would be a Strength roll (from attacker) and Strength/Agility roll (from defender).

How the GM moves characters' [[02 - Health & Damage|injury levels]] depends on the campain, but a good rule of thumb is to think how much this attack would hurt if it happened to a teenager.
