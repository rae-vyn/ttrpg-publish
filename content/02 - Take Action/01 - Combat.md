Combat in this system, unlike others, doesn't have an order by default. Instead, the combat happens asynchronously with the rest of the world.

Combat usually starts when someone gets attacked, and ends whenever a character passes out, dies, flees, or surrenders.

Evasive maneuvers or blocking are contested rolls of whatever skill is applicable. For example, a simple unarmed strike would be a Strength roll (from attacker) and Strength/Agility roll (from defender).
